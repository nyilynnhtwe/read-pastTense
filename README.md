## I am a lazy man in reading.During this pandemic,I cultivated a habit to read the limited numbers of books in each month.I want to save articles(on webs and others) and names of books in somewhere to remind me how much I read.So I did this project and chose MongoDB and bash to implement this idea.
# All you have to do is just run the run.sh file.(MongoDB client has to be installed)
